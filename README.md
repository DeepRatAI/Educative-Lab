# 🧠 Building Intelligence

### *AI Systems Engineering: From Machine Learning to Generative Intelligence*

*A DeepRat Educative Lab Program*

---

## 🌍 About the Program

**Building Intelligence** is an **open, structured, and hands-on educational program** that walks you through the full journey of **modern Artificial Intelligence** — from traditional **Machine Learning** to advanced **Generative Systems and AI Agents**.

The project is inspired by the spirit of *open education*.
Just like *Python para Todos* once opened a door for me, this program aims to open that same door for anyone eager to learn and build — no subscription, no GPU cost, no barrier.

All lessons are built in **Jupyter Notebooks**, designed for **Google Colab Free Tier** (GPU-compatible when needed), and focused on **real, reproducible AI systems**.

All lessons are available in English and Spanish!
---

## 🚀 Structure

The program is divided into **13 modules**, each containing multiple **chapters** with theoretical and practical content.

Each chapter includes:

* `leccion_teorica.md` → theory and conceptual background
* `01_nombre.ipynb` → core interactive notebook
* `ejercicios.ipynb` → practice exercises
* `soluciones.ipynb` → guided solutions
* `README.md` → learning objectives, prerequisites, and references


---

## 📅 Release Schedule

Lessons are released **weekly**, following a continuous, progressive path.

**Current module:**
📘 *Teaching Machines to Think — The Python Approach*
1️⃣ *How Machines Learn — The Language of Data*
2️⃣ *Drawing the First Line — Predicting with Simple Linear Regression*

Upcoming releases:
🗓️ *Every 7 days — new lessons and chapters published here.*

## 🧩 Learning Path Overview

| Phase                               | Focus                                             | Modules |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------ |
| **1. Machine Learning Foundations** | Core algorithms and supervised learning           | 01–02   |
| **2. Deep Learning Architectures**  | Neural networks, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch       | 03–06   |
| **3. Generative AI & LLMs**         | Transformers, fine-tuning, and large model design | 07–11   |
| **4. AI Agents & RAG Systems**      | Retrieval, context, and intelligent orchestration | 12–13   |

---

## 🧰 Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Common ML/AI libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `torch`, `tensorflow`, `transformers`, `langchain`, etc.
  *(Installation handled automatically in Colab notebooks.)*

---

## 💡 Goals

* Teach **AI engineering** through real, executable projects.
* Provide **fully open access** to high-quality, structured material.
* Bridge the gap between **theory and system implementation**.
* Empower self-learners, students, and professionals to **build real systems**, not just run demos.
