#01 – Introduction to Machine Learning

## 📋 Description

This is the first lesson of Module 1: Machine Learning with Python. In this lesson you will learn the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning, understand the different types of machine learning, and learn about the typical workflow in ML projects.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- ✅ Explain what Machine Learning is and how it differs from traditional programming
- ✅ Identify the different types of learning: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
- ✅ Understand the complete workflow of a Machine Learning project
- ✅ Recognize real applications of Machine Learning in the industry
- ✅ Configure the work environment in Google Colab
- ✅ Work with the fundamental libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn

## 📚 Content

### 1. Theory (`leccion_teorica.md`)

- What is Machine Learning?
- History and evolution of ML
- Types of Machine Learning
- Fundamental concepts (features, labels, models, training)
- The workflow in ML
- Real world applications

### 2. Guided Practice (`01_introduccion_ml.ipynb`)

- Environment configuration in Google Colab
- Introduction to NumPy and operations with arrays
- Introduction to Pandas and data manipulation
- Basic visualization with Matplotlib
- First contact with Scikit-learn
- Simple Example: Toy Linear Regression

### 3. Practical Exercises (`exercises.ipynb`)

- 5 progressive exercises to apply the concepts
- From basic concepts to an integrative mini-project

### 4. Solutions (`solutions.ipynb`)

- Detailed and explained solutions to all exercises
- Good practices and additional tips

## ⏱️ Estimated Duration

- **Theory**: 45-60 minutes
- **Guided Practice**: 60-90 minutes
- **Exercises**: 60-90 minutes
- **Total**: 3-4 hours

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Knowledge:

- Basic Python (variables, loops, functions)
- Basic mathematics (algebra, concepts of functions)
- Basic statistics notions (mean, standard deviation) - Recommended

### Tools:

- Google account (to use Google Colab)
- Modern web browser
- Internet connection

## 💻 Settings in Google Colab

All notebooks are designed to run on **Google Colab Free Tier**:

- ✅ No local installation required
- ✅ Access to free T4 GPU
- ✅ Pre-installed libraries
- ✅ Google Drive storage

### Steps to get started:

1. Open Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Upload the notebook or open it from GitHub
3. Connect to the runtime (CPU or GPU as needed)
4. Start learning!

## 📖 Recommended Study Order

1. 📄 Read `leccion_teorica.md` to understand the concepts
2. 💻 Follow `01_introduccion_ml.ipynb` executing each cell
3. ✏️ Solve `exercises.ipynb` on your own
4. ✅ Check your answers with `soluciones.ipynb`
5. 🔄 Review the concepts that were not clear

## 🎓 Key Concepts

- **Machine Learning**: Subfield of AI that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed
- **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The model finds patterns in data without labels
- **Features**: Input variables that describe the data
- **Labels**: Target variable that we want to predict- **Model**: Mathematical representation that learns patterns from data
- **Training**: Process of fitting the model to the data
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make estimates

## 📝 Important Notes

- ⚠️ Regularly save your progress to Google Drive
- 💡 Experiment by modifying the examples, it is the best way to learn
- 🤝 If you have doubts, review the theory or consult with your classmates
- 🎯 Don't worry if you don't understand everything the first time, it's normal

## ✅ Completeness Checklist
